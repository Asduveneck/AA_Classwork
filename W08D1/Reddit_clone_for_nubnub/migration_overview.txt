Write an edit route where the moderator is allowed to update 
the title and description.


Use a before_action to prohibit non-moderators 
from editing or updating the Sub.


Write posts#editand posts#update controller actions (and routes)
that only the Post author can use.

QUESTIONS!!!!!!!!!!

++ helen
Do we nest the subs beneath the users? 
Because we're creating each sub to have a moderator 
NO. Because then to access a sub we'd first access the moderator.
That's annoying.

What do we do with post subs?
We use them to check associations. 
So does that mean our postsub controller is what handles requests to/from posts and subs?
In the views, when we check those input boxes, views, it provides some info. Where we create some post sub 

When we pull up the inspect for the page, it seems that within post, there is a column for sub_ids.
But I thought we had a PostSub table to handle many-many associations...?
