1. How to get our textbox input from add ToDo 

2. Where do we set up the event listener? 
  Do that at the very end 
  And one when you clickon an actual event between done and not done (checkbox) (less important)

  An event listener for when you click the submit button
    When you click, you want to add toDo

    and prevent default
3. How do we do the storing things...?
