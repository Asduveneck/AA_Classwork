### We want answers Dean.
(optional)
1. The `componentWillUnmount` -- What does it do? 
  * The output looks the same to us. We keep console logging "hello" with every second. 
  * How do we check if there are multiple timers going on?

2. How do we get the root thing set up?
  * We render only the root
  * and the root renders everything else and passes things in as props? 

3. How do we create our tabs?
