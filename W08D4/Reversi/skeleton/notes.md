@here ALSO IMPORTANT: The instructions for today's project are very bare-bones and in the process of being updated in the curriculum. You should not build out the methods in the order that they are listed in the file, here is the recommended order I would go through them, as some of the earlier methods will act as helper methods for the later ones:
1. _makeGrid and the Constructor function
2. 3 helper methods (isMine, isOccupied, isValidPos)
3. getPiece
4. _positionsToFlip
5. validMove
6. placePiece and validMoves
7. hasMove
8. isOver



Also: run npx mocha --reporter spec instead of npm test for nicer specs (thanks Angela) (edited)
